Installation:

1.	Place the contents of the archive into the Maya scripts folder. 
	Default is: C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents\maya\<MayaVersion>\scripts

2.	Open Maya, and use this Python code to run the UI:

import controlMeshCreator
controlMeshCreator.initUI()


3. 	You can write it under Python tab of the script editor, select the whole text,
	middle-mouse drag it onto the shelf to add a button.

4.	Click the shelf button to run the script.

Usage:
1.	Select your skinned mesh and click "Set".
2.	Select desired control object\objects and click Generate button.

By default it will try to delete faces by distance. While this works good enough for face, it is a 
better idea to manually delete unnecessary faces. To do this, do the following:

1.	Select your skinned mesh and click "Set".
2.	Uncheck Auto Select and Auto Delete checkboxes.
3.	Select ONE control, and click Generate.
4.	You will have the full character mesh now, selected and probably green. It's ok.
5.	Press F8 to enter the edit mode. Switch to Face (Ctrl+RightClick on mesh - Face).
6.	Select faces you want to be 'clickable' for this control. Press Ctrl+Shift+I to invert
	the selection. 
7.	Press Delete on your keyboard.

Repeat the process for each control.
